CleaningDataProject
===================

### Introduction

This repo is for the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, part of the Coursera Data Science Specializiation.

For more information about the raw data, refer to README.txt in the zip file available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### The Raw Data

The raw data for this project are a set of measurements from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals for 30 subjects each performing 6 activities. The data are contained in the following files (all information from the README.txt file attached to the data):

'features.txt': List of all features (the output measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope).

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

The test and train folders each contain an 'Inertial Signals' subfolder, which is ignored for these analyses.

### Data Cleaning and Tidy-ing Plan

The data is in multiple tables, so the first step is to attach these tables into one master table.

* First, for both training and test data seperately, the subject data, labels and measurement data must be combined (cbind)

* Second, the training and test data sets are each assigned a flag to identify as training or test

* Third, the training and test data sets are concatenated (rbind)

* Fourth, the names (features.txt) are assigned to the dataset (along with subject_id and activity_id for the two columns previously attached to the data)

* Fifth, all feature names not including "mean()" or "std()" are excluded, as we are not interested in them

* Sixth, the character "-" is removed from variable names, as it can interfere with R reading the names

* Seventh, activity_id is set as a factor, with levels as mapped in activity_labels.txt

* Eigth, the dataset is converted to a long, tidy format. This process involves taking the mean of each feature for each subject and activity, and gathering the informative feature names into a column.

### The Code

The code to complete all steps in the Data Cleaning and Tidy-ing Plan, with full annotations, can be found in run_analysis.R
